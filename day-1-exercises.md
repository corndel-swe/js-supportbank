# Day 1 Exercises

## Exercise 1: Setting up the project

There's a few steps for setting up the supportbank project that haven't been done yet.

Have a read of [Creating a Node project](https://swe-docs.netlify.app/js/node-projects.html).

We've made a start by creating folders and initialising a git repository, but there's a few more steps to go.

1. We still need to initialise an `npm` project.
2. We need to add test scripts to the newly created `package.json` file.
3. We need to install the mocha package.

Once you've done that, you should be able to run the tests with `npm run test:d1e1`.

### Exercise 1 hints

1. You can initialise an `npm` project by running `npm init` in the root of the project.
