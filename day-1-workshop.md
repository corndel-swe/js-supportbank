# Day 1 Workshop

Now that you've got a working project, it's time to start adding some functionality to it.

## Currency converter

Let's write a currency converter. It should take an input like the following:

```bash
node cli convert 100 USD GBP
```

and return the equivalent amount in the second currency.

Feel free to hard-code the exchange rates for now. We'll improve this in a later workshop.
